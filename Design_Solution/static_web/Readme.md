To architect a scalable and secure static web application in AWS, we'll follow the steps outlined below:

1. Launch an EC2 Instance:

Sign in to the AWS console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
Click "Launch Instance" and select a free-tier eligible Linux AMI.
Choose a t2.micro instance type and accept the default configuration options.
Add storage and configure security groups to allow SSH and HTTP traffic.
Review the security settings, create a new key pair, and launch the instance.


2. SSH into the EC2 Instance and Install a Web Server:

Wait until the instance state is 'running' and then SSH into the instance using the key pair.
Change permissions on the key pair file and elevate privileges to sudo.
Update packages on the instance and install an Apache web server.
Start the web server and configure it to restart if it gets stopped.

3. Add a Static HTML File to be Served:

Navigate to the /var/www/html directory on the EC2 instance.
Create an index.html file with the desired content.
Verify the content of the index.html file.
Access the public DNS (IPv4) of the instance in a browser to view the served HTML page.
Monitoring:

For monitoring purposes, use CloudWatch dashboard and log metrics.
Generate logs and create log metrics for monitoring.
Set up a CloudWatch dashboard to read the log metrics and display real-time data.
Implement thresholds to count errors and configure email alerts for threshold breaches.
This architecture ensures the deployment of a scalable and secure static web application on an EC2 instance in AWS, with monitoring capabilities provided by CloudWatch.
